# Quake

My notes are in notes.md

## Original README from https://github.com/mwh204/id-quake.x11

this is a subset of id's release of quake with only the files required for the x11 build included.

some libraries I had to install to compile it on debian amd64:
linux-libc-dev:i386 g++-multilib libx11-dev:i386 libxext-dev:i386
